Hello there! 

My name is Wojciech Szlosek, and I work as a Software Engineer at [XTB](https://www.xtb.com).

My main focus is programming in Scala and Java, but I also take on various other software engineering responsibilities. These include tasks such as application architecture development, implementation of CI/CD processes, and more.\
I'm responsible for the technical development, maintenance, and architecture of several applications related to transactions in the financial system.

Besides my job, I'm also a Computer Science student at Jagiellonian University.\
I'm really into Deep Learning methods and software quality metrics from a research perspective. I find it fascinating to explore these areas and see how they can be applied in practice.
